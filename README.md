An extremely alpha WIP native GUI for lldb. Currently about ~5% of the way towards usable.
The basic idea is to provide vim/emacs users with a lightweight, cross-platform, easy-to-compile likeness of what you would see in a full-featured IDE debugger interface.
If you are interested or have any comments/criticism, feel free to contact me or start an Issue here. I am no expert and learning as I go.
